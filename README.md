# numbers_and_bases
Set of simple C++ programs to further understanding of numbers and bases.
convertbase.cpp: converts a number, represented as a string in one base, to a new string representing that number in a new base.
divisorsum.cpp: reads numbers, one at a time, from the terminal input, and outputs the proper divisors and the proper divisor sum for that integer in an equation format.
heavy.cpp: reads a number y and a base N from the command line (both of which are written in base-10 notation) and returns whether that number y is heavy in the base N provided.
